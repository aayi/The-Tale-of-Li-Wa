# The-Tale-of-Li-Wa
This paper uses digital technology and spatial narrative theory to represent the narrative and narrative of experience of a Chinese classic novel, The Tale of Li Wa, which has been favored by literature and historians in the past approximately 900 years. To help contemporary readers understand this classic narrative and its context more wholly and deeply, the spatio-temporal information, derived from its text, its author, and readers, is extracted and fused to map the instantaneous spatial pattern perceived by readers in the flow of reading time. These comparative patterns form a logical loop of “time–space–time–space” that helps contemporary readers once again observe the literary and historic value through spatio-temporal narratives.
